# If you're working on more than one datamapper gem at a time, then it's
# recommended to create a local Gemfile and use this instead of the git
# sources. This will make sure that you are  developing against your
# other local datamapper sources that you currently work on. Gemfile.local
# will behave identically to the standard Gemfile apart from the fact that
# it fetches the gems from local paths. This means that you can use the
# same environment variables, like ADAPTER when running bundle commands.
# Gemfile.local is added to .gitignore, so you don't need to worry about
# accidentally checking local development paths into git.
#
#   bundle exec rake local_gemfile
#
# will give you a Gemfile.local file that points to your local clones of
# the various datamapper gems. It's assumed that all datamapper repo clones
# reside in the same directory. You can use the Gemfile.local like so for
# running any bundle command:
#
#   BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.local bundle foo
#
# To speed up running bundle tasks, it's recommended to run
#
#   bundle lock
#
# after running 'bundle install' for the first time. This will make 'bundle exec' run
# a lot faster compared to the unlocked version. With an unlocked bundle you would
# typically just run 'bundle install' from time to time to fetch the latest sources from
# upstream. When you locked your bundle, you need to run
#
#   bundle install --relock
#
# to make sure to fetch the latest updates and then lock the bundle again. Gemfile.lock
# is added to the .gitignore file, so you don't need to worry about accidentally checking
# it into version control.
